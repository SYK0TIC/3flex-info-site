### ` **Your Role as Captain**

### **Managing a Team Roster**

**Team Size:** Maintain between **6 to 10 players** for gendered circuits and **6 to 12 players** for mixed circuits on your roster throughout the season.

**Weekly Lineups:** Field 3 doubles pairs (6 players) each week —captains create lineups based on availability, matchups, and team chemistry. **Lineups must be locked in at least 2 hours before match time.**

**Playoff Eligibility:** To qualify for playoffs, each player must participate in **at least 2 regular-season matches**.

**Roster Flexibility:** Add or drop players anytime during the season. New players must join **before the roster deadline** and can only play for **one team per season**.

**Minimum Requirement:** Teams dropping below 6 active players must recruit eligible replacements promptly to avoid **match forfeits or playoff disqualification**.

## **Score Reporting**

**Quick & Easy Submissions:** Captains submit match scores through the circuit's online platform within 24 hours of play.

**Verify or Confirm:** If the opposing captain enters scores first, simply review and approve them—only flag if something's off.

**Dispute Resolution:** The circuit will contact both teams if there's a scoring conflict. If no resolution is reached, the match may be voided, which could impact standings and playoff eligibility.

*Before leaving the court, have players confirm scores with their opponents to avoid disputes.*

## **Communication**

**Easy Lineup Management:** Lock in your weekly lineup through our online platform—your players are automatically notified.

**Timely Notifications:** Your finalized lineup is shared with the opposing captain **30 minutes before match time**.

**Player Absences:** Players inform captains directly about availability issues. Captains manage substitutions promptly.

**Handling Defaults:** If no substitutes are available, captains must immediately inform the opposing team about any defaulted matches.

*Court scheduling, payments, and match logistics are managed entirely by the circuit—allowing captains to focus purely on their teams.* 

## **Rule Enforcement**

**Official Standards:** All matches follow USA Pickleball rules and the circuit's Player Handbook for gameplay and sportsmanship.

**Captain Leadership:** Captains serve as the first point of contact for resolving match-related issues. Use the Player Handbook found on our website to guide minor disputes.

**Circuit Support:** If a situation can't be resolved using circuit resources, captains may escalate the issue to circuit staff for review.

**Match Balls:** The official circuit ball is the **Franklin X40**. The designated home team must provide **6 new balls** for each match to ensure smooth, uninterrupted play.

## **Team Leadership**

As captain, you shape your team's culture. The circuit encourages you to lead with **fairness, positivity, and inclusion** building camaraderie and healthy competition.

Captains are also responsible for setting the tone on **sportsmanship, communication, and team coordination** throughout the season.
